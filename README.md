# CREDIT-CARD-ANOMALY-DETECTION
Machine Learning - Credit Card Fraud Detection Introduction The objective in this project is to build machine learning models to classify or identify fraudulent card transactions from a given card transactions data. Data Description The dataset contains two-days credit card transactions made in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced with a low percentage of fraudulent transactions within several records of normal transactions. The positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% (492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions) of all transactions. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. Feature 'Class' is the target variable with value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
